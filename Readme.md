# From Data To Glory: FIFA Player Analytics

Harness the power of neural networks and machine learning to predict player positions and overall ratings in FIFA Ultimate Team.

## Overview

This project blends sports analytics with advanced ML techniques to unlock hidden insights in the FIFA dataset. By exploring key player statistics and employing a variety of models—from deep neural networks to ensemble methods—the project offers actionable intelligence for optimizing team strategy and player performance.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration & Feature Engineering:**  
  Clean and transform raw FIFA data, engineer new features (such as simplified position indicators and binary flags), and perform comprehensive statistical analysis.

- **Diverse Modeling Approaches:**  
  - **Regression Models:** Utilize Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to predict overall ratings with high precision.  
  - **Classification Models:** Apply CNNs, RNNs, and dense deep learning networks to accurately classify player positions.

- **Interpretability:**  
  Detailed analysis of feature importance reveals that attributes like _Potential_, _Age_, and _Reactions_ are key predictors in the models.


## Results

### Regression Models
- **Random Forest Regressor:** Achieved an R² of approximately 0.98 with an RMSE of about 1.06.
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** Produced competitive performance with similarly low error rates.

### Classification Models
- Deep learning architectures attained around 89% accuracy in predicting player positions.
- Analysis indicates that **Potential**, **Age**, and **Reactions** are the top predictors affecting overall performance.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how the fusion of data science and football analytics can drive smart, data-driven decision-making. By predicting player ratings and positions using robust machine learning techniques, the work paves the way for improved tactical insights in both virtual and real-world soccer analytics.
